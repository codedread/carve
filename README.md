# Carve

## About

Playing around with a simple SVG editor web app that has zero runtime dependencies.

This doesn't do much yet, but you can try out [the demo](https://codedread.github.io/carve/) if
you're curious. It has a couple shape tools, a Select tool, and a Delete button.

## Supported Browsers

  * Chromium-based (Chrome, Edge, Opera)
  * No support in Firefox and Safari yet.

This demo uses modern web standards and technologies that are not broadly supported on the web,
such as the [Native File System API](https://wicg.github.io/file-system-access/) and
[Custom Elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements).
