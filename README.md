# Carve

## About

Playing around with a simple SVG editor web app that has zero runtime dependencies.

Working towards building a [very basic editor](https://github.com/codedread/carve/projects/1), this demo doesn't do much yet, but you can [try it out](https://codedread.github.io/carve/). It has a couple shape tools, basic selection, delete, undo/redo.

## Supported Browsers

  * Chromium-based (Chrome, Edge, Opera)
  * No support in Firefox and Safari yet.

This demo uses modern web standards and technologies that are not broadly supported on the web,
such as the [Native File System API](https://wicg.github.io/file-system-access/) and
[Custom Elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements).
